            Bootstrap is described as an HTML, CSS, and JS framework which is used to develop mobile-first,
            responsive projects. It’s important to add that Bootstrap is an open-source tool that helps thousands of
            people create prototypes of their projects or build apps from start to finish using design time-savers like
            Sass variables included in Bootstrap’s built-in tools. It comes equipped with
            a grid system, pre-built components, and plugins that are built with jQuery to fit any project.
